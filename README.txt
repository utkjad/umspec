Inside the zip file, there is a spec for a language and an image file written in that language. We’d like you to implement the spec and get the image running. Once you get it working, it should prompt you for an encryption key, and you can stop once you get there. [1]

Please choose your own tools, language, etc.; the only requirements are that you get the image running and that your implementation be unique from other known implementations.

We are really looking forward to seeing what you come up with! If you have any other questions, please let us know.


[1] Not required, but helpful context: the problem is sourced from a warmup exercise from an old International Conference of Functional Programming contest: http://boundvariable.org/index.shtml

There are answers at the site in several languages and you are welcome to check them out. For example, the c-tom implementation is a C version that implements the whole thing in about 150 lines of code. There are also other “UM” images you can use to test your implementation.  The coding challenges on that page are NOT part of this coding challenge.
