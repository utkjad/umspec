Hi Utkarsh,

Thank you for taking time to get to know Lexumo!  We have enjoyed spending time with you and are excited to take our conversations to the next step.  To kick this off, we want to invite you to show off your skills and have some fun with the coding challenge outlined below. If you have recently completed a coding challenge of similar complexity for another interview or for fun, you can send that to us instead (just remember to include the instructions, so we have all the context). Your choice!

You will find the coding challenge question at the bottom of this e-mail.  You may send us the results in any format you like; however, we have a preference for terminal capture (e.g., https://asciinema.org) whenever possible, because it gives us better insight to your process. Feel free to break it up if necessary, and please don't spend more than a few hours on it. It is intentionally open ended for the followup questions.  Use your own tools, language, etc. Feel free to post results to a github-like site or just tarball/zip and send it back to us.

Inside the zip file, there is a spec for a language and an image file written in that language. We’d like you to implement the spec and get the image running. Once you get it working, it should prompt you for an encryption key, and you can stop once you get there. [1]

Please choose your own tools, language, etc.; the only requirements are that you get the image running and that your implementation be unique from other known implementations.

We are really looking forward to seeing what you come up with! If you have any other questions, please let us know.

Thanks,
-The Lexumo Team

[1] Not required, but helpful context: the problem is sourced from a warmup exercise from an old International Conference of Functional Programming contest: http://boundvariable.org/index.shtml

There are answers at the site in several languages and you are welcome to check them out. For example, the c-tom implementation is a C version that implements the whole thing in about 150 lines of code. There are also other “UM” images you can use to test your implementation.  The coding challenges on that page are NOT part of this coding challenge.
